# Epidemiology of Toxicity in the Reddit Hyperlink Network

## Data Story Website

As part of our participiation in the EPFL course Applied Data Analysis (CS-401), four EPFL collegues and I conducted a project aiming to analyse, classify and interpret the diffusion of negativity in speech on the Reddit platform.

While the repo in which we conducted our entire analysis and stored our results is unfortunately held by the EPFL organisation and cannot be made public, I designed a digestible and interactive website that meticulously documents our entire research and findings as a "data story", accessible here: https://ctordo.github.io/reddit-hyperlink-network-project-datastory.
